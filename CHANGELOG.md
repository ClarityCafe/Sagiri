## [4.0.0] - 2024-08-26

### Changed

- **BREAKING** - Interfaces have been renamed to use the hungarian notation style (e.g. `SagiriResult` is now `ISagiriResult`). Please adapt your code accordingly.
- **BREAKING** - ESM support has been added to allow the module to be used on Node.js 16+ code that uses ESM code.
- **BREAKING** - Bun and Deno support has been added. Library contributors are encouraged to try the library on these platforms and avoid any Node.js specific code.
